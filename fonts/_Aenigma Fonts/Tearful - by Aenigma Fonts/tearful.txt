Thanks for Downloading Tearful.

--To use this Font start out with either a Capital or lower case letter
then with the next letter 'Alternate' the Case to make the letters
connect.  Keep doing this until you finish you word.  For example
type in your word like this "TeArFuL".

--You can also just have all Top 'Tears' or all bottom 'Tears' by
typing a letter then a space then a letter and so on.  For example
for all Top 'Tears' type your word like this "T E A R F U L", and for
all bottom 'Tears' type your word like this "t e a r f u l".

--If you want a Blank 'Tear' use + for a top 'Tear' and = for a
bottom 'Tear'.

--For the numbers all of the bottom 'Tears' are the "1234567890" and
for the top 'Tears' press Shift+The Number  "!@#$%^&*()"

This font has been updated!  I've edited the (BRK) in the font name
to just BRK.  It seems that Adobe Illustrator and web pages with CSS
don't like fonts with ( and ) in their name.

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file [.ttf] into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press F5 (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).
