Thanks for Downloading CLAW.


This font is best used at LARGE point sizes.

  I've included 2 CLAW fonts.  They're exactly the same but with these
differences:
> CLAW 1 - Characters imported into Fontographer.  The characters are
a bit larger that CLAW 2's characters.

> CLAW 2 - Characters imported into ScanFont/FontLab.  The characters
are a bit more detailed than CLAW 1's characters.

  When importing .ai and/or .eps files into ScanFont and FontLab, the
characters show up smaller, but are more detailed.  Scaling them within
ScanFont/Fontlab only messes them up (the font is displayed as a
different (default) font in most programs).  When importing .ai and/or
.eps files into Fontographer, the character sizes are correct but the
lines and curves are 'Degraded'.  You probably won't notice any
differences unless you zoom in really close to the characters of each
font.  I just decided to include both fonts.

This font has been updated!  I've edited the (BRK) in the font name
to just BRK.  It seems that Adobe Illustrator and web pages with CSS
don't like fonts with ( and ) in their name.

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file [.ttf] into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press F5 (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).
