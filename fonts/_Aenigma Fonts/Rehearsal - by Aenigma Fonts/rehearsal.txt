Thanks for Downloading Rehearsal.

-Rehearsal Curve  [.ttf]
-Rehearsal Point  [.ttf]
-Rehearsal Offset [.ttf]

I've also included some extra Bitmap fonts.  These fonts are how the
font originally looked but they didn't work/look that great as TTF's,
but I still wanted to include them.
-Layers 0 [23pt]  [.fon]
-Layers 1 [44pt]  [.fon]
-Layers 2 [44pt]  [.fon]
-Layers 3 [44pt]  [.fon]
-Layers 4 [44pt]  [.fon]

The Layers fonts have 2 extra characters, an Empty 'Cell' and a Filled
'Cell'.  These characters are used for spaces.

[KEY]
EXTRA CHARACTER = ACTUAL CHARACTER = ALT# CODE
Empty 'Cell'  = È = ALT+0200
Filled 'Cell' = É = ALT+0201

To type the extra characters, Press and Hold the ALT key, then
on the Number Pad type in the 4 numbers.  When you release the
ALT key the character will appear.


  All of the 'layers#.fon' fonts are Windows Bitmap Fonts (.fon).
These fonts are best used at 44pt. for fonts 1-4 and 23pt. for font 0.
To use them at larger point sizes (for images), try using a graphics
program like Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or the Paint program that
comes with Windows.  Type out your text at the recommended point
size [23pt for 0 and 44pt for 1-4], then resize the image.   Set the
color mode to 256 or 2 colors so the edges don't get blured when
resizing, then after you have the text to the size that you want, then
change back to a higher color mode and edit the image.

  For programs that don't show Bitmap Fonts in the Font Selector, you
may be able to get the font to work by typing in:
layers 0 -brk-
layers 1 -brk-
layers 2 -brk-
layers 3 -brk-
layers 4 -brk-

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file(s) into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs that utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press F5 (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).
